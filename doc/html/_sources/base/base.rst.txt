Base package
===============

Base package includes classes that help you make different basic tasks related to ML models and analytics


Classes
===============
.. py:class:: Coin

        The *Coin* class let's you define a charged coin with some probability value bwtween 0 and 1
        
        .. py:attribute:: probability

        It's a float value between 0 and 1 which indicates the probability of the positive event. For ecample a Coin with probability 0.3 will return positive aproximately 30 times fif we run the toss metods 100 tosses.
        
        .. py:method:: __init__(probability)

        Instantiates a Coin object with a given probability
        
        .. py:method:: toss()

        Return True or False, true if the event were evaluated positively, False otherwise

.. py:class:: Dataset

Thr *Dataset* class is a simple abstraction of a dataset multidimensional, wich can be fed to a model, it includes method to normalize the data, add bias plot, and split the data in train, test and validation datasets
